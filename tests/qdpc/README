This directory contains a QDP wrapper and the timing code for the inverter.
It also contains various test codes for verifying correctness of the inverter.

Interesting files:

results of inverting U=1, by running cg-solver1 as follows:
   ./cg-solver1.. 8 8 8 16 16 10 0.1 1e-30 500
8-3-16-2-1-altivecf-single
8-3-16-2-1-ssed-single

results of random U, by running cg-solver as follows:
